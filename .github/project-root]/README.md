# ETL Project

## Overview
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process designed to automate the extraction of data from various sources, transform it according to business rules, and load it into a target system. The workflow is managed using GitHub Actions to ensure seamless integration and deployment.

## Project Structure
```

├── requirements.txt          # Python dependencies for the project
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Set up any necessary environment variables required for the ETL process.

## Usage
To run the ETL process locally, execute the following command:
```bash
python src/etl/main.py
```

## GitHub Actions Workflow
The ETL process is automated using GitHub Actions. The workflow is triggered on:
- Nightly execution
- Manual dispatch
- Merges to the main branch

The workflow includes steps for:
- Building the application
- Running linting and tests
- Packaging the application into a container
- Deploying to Cloud Run
- Sending notifications to Grafana or Slack upon completion
