# GitLens PR Review Protocol

## Purpose
Ensure every changelog entry and release is traceable to its authorship, review, and operational context using GitLens Pro.

## Ritual Steps

1. **Authorship & History**
   - Use GitLens to inspect file and line authorship for every changelog entry.
   - Link each changelog entry to its PR or commit hash in the changelog (e.g., `([#123](https://github.com/alphafundbot/alphafund/pull/123))`).

2. **Review Discipline**
   - Use GitLens Visual File History to review all changes included in a release.
   - Annotate PRs with `type:` labels for changelog mapping.

3. **Operational Verification**
   - Before merging, verify the changelog entry matches the actual code changes using GitLens Diff.
   - Confirm that the release artifact matches the committed `CHANGELOG.md`.

4. **Ceremonial Audit**
   - For each release, use GitLens to generate a summary of contributors and reviewers.
   - Attach this summary to the release notes or Slack notification if desired.

## Example Changelog Entry

_This protocol is sovereign. All deviations must be justified in the PR description._
